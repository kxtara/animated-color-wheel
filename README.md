## Overview

This was fun to make as I tried out different ways to come up with the outcome that you now see.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

I just finished going over animation,transitions, and transforms, so I thought that I should make something simple.
I started with structuring the HTML and then styling it with CSS. I played around with the percentages for the keyframe to get the outcome I wanted, which was a rainbow effect.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This project put my CSS knowledge to the test, and I learned more about animations.Â 

```css
@keyframes rotation {
  from {
    transform: rotate(0deg);
  }
  to {
    transform: rotate(180deg);
  }
}
```

### Continued development

Moving forward, I would like to continue practicing animating elements.

### Useful resources
